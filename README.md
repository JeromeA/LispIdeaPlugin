# LispIdeaPlugin

An IntelliJ plugin to support Common Lisp.

## Approach

The only other plugin adding support for Common Lisp is [SLT](https://github.com/Enerccio/SLT). Go and try it! It's more advanced than this one.

This plugin tries to support Common Lisp through static analysis. It's more work, but it allows better real-time features.

## Status

It's still at a very early development stage. It's unlikely to work on anything but my own personal projects.
